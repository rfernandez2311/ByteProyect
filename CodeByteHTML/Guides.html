                     <h3><b>Ryzen 7 1800X</b></h3>
                     <p>PC Gamer’s high-end PC build guide is aimed at a price tier of around $2,000,
                           but we're not afraid to go a bit higher if we feel it's justified. We'll also 
                           provide some easy downgrades if you're looking to trim things down. At this tier,
                           we push for a powerful graphics card and an overclockable processor to run today's games
                           at their highest possible performance. And this rig will still be able to handle games 
                           that come out years from now at respectable settings.</p>

                     <h4><b>Core i7-8700K</b></h4>
                     <p>The only thing to watch out for is the size of the MSI Gaming X Trio size.
                        Had to run a 120mm fan at bottom, and actually helps to prop the card up and eliminate any GPU sag. 
                        Eventually I will cut the metal shroud insert from the Meshify C, to cover up my cables in the basement.
                        Also, removed the drive tray frame and just attached the 2TB HDD directly onto the bottom of the case to free up more room for cable management.
                        Overall beast of a machine that runs super quiet and cool. Stock temps are in low 30's and I max out at 60 when heavy gaming. 
                        Superior air flow with this case and cooler/fan set up. 140mm and 120mm in front, 120mm in back, and a 140 running out the top above cooler.
                        A bit of an odd mix but all black fans make it unnoticeable and almost zero dust gets intot he syste</p>

                     <h4><b>Coffee Lake Gaming Rig</b></h4>
                     <p>The Zotac 1080ti has great cooling so you can OC and squeeze a little more performance from it.
                          I chose a cost effective and reliable AIO cooler should you choose to OC your CPU its quieter
                           than air cooling and will keep your temps within the 45–70 c range (Idle and at Load). 
                           The Nvme is for your OS and programs i have this exact SSD in my RIG and its lightning fast 
                           cold boot to loaded takes about 15 seconds. I also have a Firecuda in my RIG and is a great 
                           balance between loading time for games and storage size the 1 TB WD drive is for your music, 
                           videos and pictures it should be more than enough for now and you can always add more later, 
                           Lastly the case i have had a few cases from Gamemax and they were great the Vega has a big 
                           clear perspex panel along with LED RGB lighting and case fans with a speed and lighting 
                           controller to show off the internals and the lighting can be changed to suit your mood.</p>
