Part lists broken out by filterable categories to ensure you include all the necessary components. Automatic compatibility guidance limits choices to parts known to be compatible and warns you if you pick incompatible parts. Continuously updated prices from dozens of the most popular online retailers. Part price alerts let you set price thresholds on specific parts. Easily enable/disable mail-in rebates and per-retailer tax rates in price calculations.
